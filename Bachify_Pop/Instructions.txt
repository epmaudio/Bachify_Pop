In Partial Fulfilment of Master of Science in Sound Design

Project: Bachify-ing Pop:
	 Coding a Fugue ExpositionArrangement Program based in 5th Species Counterpoint Using Existing Song Materials
 

 --- Python Code Instructions --- 

Python Packages to install before running code: 
	Use pip install or simular 
	Example: pip install librosa
		 pip install <<name_of_pakage>>

librosa
pydub 
soundfile
ffmpeg
spicy 
matplotlib.pyplot
sklearn

Additional Packages Used to Run Code: 
	Should be already ready to run with Python 

numpy
random 
os 
argparse

 ---- How to run the code -----

1. Make sure all packages are installed 
	Use pip or pip3 or another way to install the above packages 
	Example: pip install librosa

2. Place the WAV files of the songs you wish to use in the same folder as the python code files, note the names of the WAV files
	Please ensure the song files have no spaces in the names (use _ or - instead)
	Files needed for the examples come in the Bachify_Pop Folder

3. Running Slice_Audio.py
	3.1 open terminal or anaconda
	3.2 make a path to Bachify_Pop folder
	3.3 type the line: python Slice_Audio.py --song Name_of_Song
	Example: 
		path/to/Bachify_Pop python Slice_Audio.py --song Ribs
		path/to/Bachify_Pop python Slice_Audio.py --song HelloFuture

4. Sorting Audio Chunks 
	4.1 make a folder (named the same as the song you are Bachify-ing) with subfolders labelled A B C D 
	4.2 pick which chunks will go in each folder (each folder must have at least 1 song chunk)
	4.3 If you want to follow the rules of fugue follow the chart below  

		Alpha	Pop Song	Fugue Exposition
		A	Verse 		Subject
		B	Chorus		Counter Subject
		C 	Bridge		Answer or Counter Subject 2
		D 	Other 		Free

5. Running PutTogether_Files.py
	5.1 open terminal 
	5.2 make a path to Bachify_Pop folder
	5.3 python PutTogether_Files.py --folder Name_of_Folder 
	Example: 
		path/to/Bachify_Pop python PutTogether_Files.py --folder Ribs

6. Enjoy your songs
