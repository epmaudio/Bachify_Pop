# Bachify_Pop
## A Fugue Exposition Arrangement Program based in 5th Species Counterpoint Using Existing Song Materials
Using Python modules the user can take any existing pop song and arrange the song into a form mirroring that of Bach's fugues from the Well Tempered Clavier I. 


This program was made to fulfill Master program requirements and will be updated as I learn more.
